    <h1>Climate Change</h1>
    <p class="fontMake"> Introduction: <br> &ensp;Climate is the long tong term shifts in temperature
      and weather patterns due high rise in global greenhouse gas and natural phenomena such as the solar cycle.
      However, since the discovery of the fossil fuel and its uses since the 1800s, the greenhouse gas emission have accelerated the climate change.
      <br>  &ensp;
      <br> Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report:
      <br>  &ensp;&ensp;•	Global surface temperature will continue to increase until at least mid-century under all emissions scenarios considered. Global warming of 1.5°C and 2°C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless deep reductions in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades.
      <br>
      <br> &ensp;&ensp;•	Many changes in the climate system become larger in direct relation to increasing global warming. They include increases in the frequency and intensity of hot extremes, marine heatwaves, heavy precipitation, and, in some regions, agricultural and ecological droughts; an increase in the proportion of intense tropical cyclones; and reductions in Arctic Sea ice, snow cover and permafrost.
      <br>
      <br>&ensp; &ensp;•	Continued global warming is projected to further intensify the global water cycle, including its variability, global monsoon precipitation and the severity of wet and dry events.
      <br>
      <br>&ensp; &ensp;•	Under scenarios with increasing CO2 emissions, the ocean and land carbon sinks are projected to be less effective at slowing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere.
      <br>
      <br>&ensp; &ensp;•	Many changes due to past and future greenhouse gas emissions are irreversible for centuries to millennia, especially changes in the ocean, ice sheets and global sea level.
